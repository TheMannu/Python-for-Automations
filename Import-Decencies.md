The two commands which are essential for managing dependencies in a Python project:

1. **`pip freeze > requirements.txt`**:  
   - This command captures all the currently installed Python packages in your environment and writes them to a `requirements.txt` file, listing each package with its specific version.
   - This file can then be shared with others or used later to recreate the same environment, ensuring that all dependencies are consistent across different setups.

2. **`pip install -r requirements.txt`**:  
   - This command reads the `requirements.txt` file and installs each package listed in it with the specified versions.
   - It’s useful for setting up a new environment or restoring the same environment on another system, ensuring compatibility and avoiding issues due to version mismatches.

Together, these commands allow to easily replicate and share the dependencies of our project.

This sequence of commands helps manage dependencies and run a Python script (`main.py`). Here’s what each command does:

1. **`pip freeze > requirements.txt`**: This command generates a `requirements.txt` file listing all installed packages and their versions in the current environment. This is useful for ensuring that other environments can replicate the exact dependencies.

2. **`pip install -r requirements.txt`**: This command installs all the packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file. It's commonly used to set up environments with consistent dependencies.

3. **`python main.py`**: This command runs the `main.py` Python script. It’s the final step after ensuring that all necessary dependencies are installed.

If you're preparing this for deployment or sharing the project, these commands help ensure others can recreate the exact environment and run the project as intended.
